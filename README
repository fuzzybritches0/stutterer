A voice recorder that uses samples to record spoken text (implemented in bash)

the file stutterer.deb can be installed on any debian-derived system that has pulseaudio-utils available.

like so:
	$ sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils (very likely already installed)
	$ sudo dpkg -i stutterer.deb

it uses parec and paplay to do the job.
